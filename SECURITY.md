# Security policy

Security is a core design constraint of chatgpt-ebay. The connector receives credentials and sends
requests to eBay on behalf of authenticated callers, so suspected vulnerabilities must be handled
privately.

## Supported versions

This project is currently pre-1.0. Security fixes are applied to the latest commit on `main`; older
commits and deployments are not supported. Pin deployments to a reviewed commit and monitor the
repository for updates.

## Report a vulnerability

Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting flow:

<https://github.com/ashergarland/chatgpt-ebay/security/advisories/new>

Do not open a public issue, discussion, or pull request for an undisclosed vulnerability. Include:

- the affected commit or version;
- the required configuration and eBay environment;
- clear reproduction steps or a minimal proof of concept;
- the potential impact and blast radius; and
- any suggested remediation.

Remove credentials, Azure identifiers, seller or buyer information, and sensitive logs. The
maintainer will acknowledge the report, investigate it, and coordinate a fix and disclosure. Please
allow a reasonable remediation period before publishing details.

If private vulnerability reporting is unavailable, open a public issue containing no vulnerability
details and ask the maintainer to establish a private reporting channel.

## Deployment responsibilities

Operators are responsible for:

- keeping connector and eBay credentials separate and rotating both;
- limiting access to Key Vault and the deployed connector;
- using the eBay sandbox until production Browse API access is approved;
- reviewing the generated OpenAPI document and infrastructure changes before deployment;
- choosing rate limits and result limits appropriate for their environment; and
- monitoring authentication failures, throttling, upstream errors, and availability.

The [deployment guide](docs/deployment.md) contains hardening and operational guidance. Never use
sample credentials or unrestricted access in production.
